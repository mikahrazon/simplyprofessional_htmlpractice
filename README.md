# simplyprofessional_htmlpractice
I attempted to implement the design (https://github.com/mikahrazon/simplyprofessional) I created, for HTML/CSS practice only.  
I deviated a quite a bit from my original design, where I instead placed the social media icons at the footer area. Also, I made the home area span the whole browser window. It was good practice!
